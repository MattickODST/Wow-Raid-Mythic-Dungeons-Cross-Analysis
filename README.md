# Wow-Raid-Mythic-Dungeons-Cross-Analysis
#    Hi! Welcome to my cross analysis of my World of Warcraft guild's raiders.
#
#    Some Background.
#        I am the guild leader and raid leader of a World of Warcraft guild of about 300 players.  Twice a week we have a raid that includes about 25 or so players. Some of these players also do dungeons outside of our normal raid times. I want to compare the performance of those raiders and see how much improvement they're gaining in raid by also doing dungeons.

# This project will combine multiple week over week raid logs and compare them with an overview of the players numbers of dungeons done.

# This project will have the following features: 
# It will merge multiple log files.
# It will extrapolate the necessary data to perform the analysis.
# It will compare the data sets.
# It will clean the data to make it usable.
# It will present the data in 3 different visualizations and create a usable .csv file.
